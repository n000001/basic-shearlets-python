Basics of shearlets in python with pyShearLab (https://na.math.uni-goettingen.de/pyshearlab/)

From a small university project I did on Shearlet transforms in python. Back then I was looking for a beginner's guide and pieces of code for a quick start but I did not find much material. So, to whoever it might help: 

In pyShearLab : 
* How to construct and visualize a shearlet system
* Application of the shearlet transform to image denoising
* Application to image inpainting
